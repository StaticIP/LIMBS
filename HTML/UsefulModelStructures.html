        <h1>Useful Model Structures</h1>
        
        There are many different types of models that you can create using the LIMBS framework, 
        but if you are unsure where to start, you can always try applying one of the three generic 
        model structures given in this section. These model structures are designed to be 
        relatively general and application agnostic, so you may be able to apply them to several 
        fields, ranging from economics to politics to sociology.
 
        <br /><br />
 
        These generic models are not intended to solve every problem. They are just models that 
        the creators of the LIMBS framework found immediately useful for modelling many human 
        systems, such as stock markets (using the Free-For-All model), historic negotiations 
        (using the Diplomacy model) and small conflict resolution (using the Corporation model). 
        Also, these models are meant to be changed, to be tweaked and fiddled with, in order to 
        best suit your simulation needs.

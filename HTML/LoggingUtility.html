        <h1>The Logging Utility</h1>
		
		The logging utility is designed to allow for the results of the simulation to be logged as a
		common separated value (.csv) file, to be analyzed afterwards in a spreadsheet application. Doing this
		is really quite simple. First, you create a Logging Utility and place it in the system. Then, you
		double-click on it to open it's interface, where you can set the file using the "Browse" button. This
		utility will log each and every message it receives, so all you have to do now is make sure that the
		Agents you want to log are sending it some!
		
		<br /><br />
		The Logging Utility also displays a plot of all of the message information it has gotten over the last
		twenty iterations, so you can get a quick idea of what the simulation is doing.

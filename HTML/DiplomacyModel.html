        <h1>The Diplomacy Model</h1>
        
        The Diplomacy model is based on the notion of groups using representatives to ease 
        communication with each other, or to make decisions on their behalf. The first step is 
        to create a general “world group,” allowing everyone in the simulation to access necessary 
        propositions such as the potential outcomes of the diplomacy. These are likely to all be 
        either action nodes (in fact, in a pure Diplomacy model, all actions go here) or evidence 
        nodes. In each group, you may add evidence and goal neurons to represent propositions 
        known implicitly to that group but not the others. Examples of these would be sacred 
        values. In the Diplomacy model, groups form a sort of flower pattern, with a core group 
        with all the representatives, and attached groups, like petals, for the represented 
        populations. Overall, the Diplomacy model may look like this:

        <br /><br />
        
        Each represented group looks a little bit like a Free-For-All model! This is intended, 
        since the Diplomacy model abstracts away the complicated patterns of how all the members 
        in a society communicate, and instead focuses on the diplomats communicating in the 
        middle group. Now this model does make the assumption that there is no non-diplomat 
        agent that is a member of two (or more!) groups. You have the ability to change this if 
        you do so choose by making some of the represented groups overlap and putting those agents 
        in the overlapping place.

        <br /><br />

        Ideal uses for this model may include:

        <ul>
            <li>international negotiation and diplomacy,</li>
            <li>democratic action with defined constituencies,</li>
            <li>and any problem where there are relatively few agents communicating with each 
            other on behalf of a larger group of agents.</li>
        </ul>

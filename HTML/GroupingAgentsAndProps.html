        In the LIMBS framework, Groups are used to organize and structure the model on a 
        system-wide level. Specifically, Groups are used to group together Agents which can 
        communicate with each other and share some attributes as well as propositions that those 
        Agents can communicate about. To put an Agent in a group, just drag and drop the agent 
        into the Group box. Note that Groups can overlap, meaning that an Agent can be part of 
        multiple groups.

        The scope of a Proposition is also determined by the group it is in. A Proposition is 
        accessible to every Agent in every Group that the Proposition is also in. This means that 
        Propositions, like Agents, can be dragged and dropped into Group boxes to illustrate what 
        Group they belong to, and also can belong to multiple groups.

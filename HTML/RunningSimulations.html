        <h1>Running a Simulation</h1>
        
        So, you've created your simulation, and now you want to run it. Great! Running your 
        simulation is quite simple. Just move your mouse pointer over the “Play” button in the 
        top right-hand panel, and click once. The simulation should start shortly. You will be 
        able to view the simulation progression in the main canvas.
        
        <br /><br />
        
        Also, the simulation can be paused at any time using the “Pause” button. When you press 
        “Play” again, the simulation will continue with all the messages, and agent states as it 
        had when you paused. If you want to reset the simulation to its initial state, say, to 
        show to a fellow researcher, you can press the “Reset” button during the paused simulation.
        
        <br /><br />
        
        If you need to add/remove/modify any aspect of the application (agent, group, proposition, 
        etc.), you will need to reset the simulation to the starting point, either by selecting 
        “Pause”, then “Reset”, make your changes, then run the simulation again.
        
        <br /><br />
        
        If you have missed a step in creating your simulation, a message screen will appear when 
        you press “Play”, indicating which components of your simulation need work. You will need 
        to fix these problems before the simulation can be run.

        <h1>The Corporation Model</h1>
        
        Another useful model is the Corporation model. Just as the Diplomacy model built on the 
        Free-For-All model, the Corporation Model builds on the Diplomacy model! It does this by 
        creating layers of Diplomacy models in a tree-like fashion, where each group of diplomats 
        is considered a represented group for another group of diplomats. This creates a 
        hierarchical structure where there is a top-most level of diplomats (think of a group 
        composed of the CEO, CFO, etc... of an actual corporation) and each diplomat has a 
        subgroup that they communicate with. This interleaving of Diplomat models allows for 
        hierarchal organizations to be modelled. The Corporation model may look like this:
        
        <br /><br />
        
        Ideal uses for this model may include:
        <ul>
            <li>decision making in corporations,</li>
            <li>group dynamics within a bureaucracy,</li>
            <li>and any problem where there is a defined hierarchy where each level in the 
            hierarchy only communicates with the ones above and below.</li>
        </ul>

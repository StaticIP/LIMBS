		            &nbsp;&nbsp;There are several properties of the LIMBS application that can be changed according to your preferences. 
		            To modify these properties, go to File->Preferences in the main menu. A new window will open, with three 
		            tabs: Simulation, Agent, and General. Each of these tabs allow you to change different properties of the 
		            application.

			        In the Simulation preferences tab, you can change the size of Agents and Propositions as they appear on the 
			        canvas. The size options are small, medium, and large, with the default being medium. You can also change 
			        whether or not the Agent and Proposition names are displayed alongside the shapes, or whether the names only 
			        appear when you hover over  the objects (this is the default setting). Finally, you can modify the canvas
			        framerate - this corresponds to how frequently the canvas is redrawn during the simulation. If you makes 
			        changes to any of these preferences, be sure to click the "Save" or "Save & Close" button.

			        prefer and save to update your preferred window size.

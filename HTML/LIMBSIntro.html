	<h1>What is the LIMBS Framework</h1>
	<p>
    	Locally Integrated Multi-Brain Systems (LIMBS) Framework is not 
    	just an agent based modelling framework, but a new way of thinking 
    	about the construction of agent based models and their application 
    	to integrating the social and cognitive sciences. So, what makes 
    	LIMBS so special? Well...
	</p>
	

	<h3>1. Symbol-Based Graphical User Interface:</h4>
	<p>
    	The LIMBS framework allows you to define agent based models on two 
    	levels: a system-wide level and an agent-internal level. By separating 
    	this two interfaces, both can act independently of the other, and both 
    	can act is a primarily visual framework, so constructing basic models 
    	will be as easy as dragging and dropping a few agents and groups in the 
    	system-wide interface, and customizing each agent using the 
    	agent-internal interface.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>2. Psychological Plausibility:</h4> 
	<p>
    	All implementations of the LIMBS framework come with a built-in HOTCO editor, 
    	allowing you to create agents leveraging the proven psychological plausibility 
    	of HOTCO 3 with a more flexible framework for communication, with more options 
    	for customizing emotional transfer, than standard HOTCO. That’s why the LIMBS 
    	framework does more than just multi-agent modelling, but multi-brain modelling.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>3. Open Source Modifiability:</h4>
	<p>
    	The source code for the LIMBS framework is specifically designed to make adding 
    	your own single agent modelling frameworks as easy as possible, and still be 
    	integrated with the other agents. So you can have HOTCO agents discuss politics 
    	with Nengo agents, while a Production System and Fuzzy Logic System battle it out 
    	in an economics debate. The LIMBS framework allows you as the user to add whatever
    	agent types you need for your simulation.
	</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p>
    	The LIMBS Framework provides an easy-to-use, intuitive way of designing and running 
    	agent based models, making psychological plausibility the default, bringing agent based 
    	models to every social or cognitive scientist, regardless of their computer literacy or 
    	programming background.
	</p>

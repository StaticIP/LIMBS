            Welcome to the LIMBS Framework, a new tool for designing scalable sociocognitive
            models using the agent based modelling paradigm!

            This help menu is designed to help get you on your way to creating models, whether
            you are a new user looking for a quick guide to creating your first model, or you
            are an experienced user, looking for pro tips and tricks for honing your model. If
            you are new to the system, we strongly recommend the "Starting a New Model" sections
            of the help manual. If you are looking for an introduction to more LIMBS Framework
            features, try the "Advanced LIMBS Features" section. If you are interested in
            learning a systematic way of creating social structures, we strongly recommend the
            section on "Useful Model Structures," essentially design patterns for LIMBS!

<html>    <body>            <h1>The Agent Interface</h1>				The last aspect of extending agents and utilities is providing an interface for the user		to interact with the agent's internal mechanism. This is achieved through the AgentInterface		class, which is automatically connected to the agent using an observer pattern.<br/><br/>				In the Agent or Utility, the only method needed is the getAgentLevelInterface() function,		which should return a new copy of the AgentInterface. This interface will automatically		receive updates from the agent or utility, calling the refresh() method whenever that		occurs.			</body></html>

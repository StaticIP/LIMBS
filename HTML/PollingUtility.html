        <h1>The Polling Utility</h1>
		
		The Polling Utility allows for information from multiple agents to be aggregated and reported,
		similar to a referendum. The Polling Utility therefore has three notions: those of a constituency,
		the issues in the referendum, and who to report the results to.
		
		<br /><br />
		
		But first, you need to define the election period. The Polling Utility runs period elections, the
		structure of which can be defined by the "Time Before the First Election," "Polling Time" and "Time
		Between Elections" boxes in the upper right corner of the interface. The "Time Before The First Election"
		lets you offset the first election by some amount, all election afterwards having being periodic over
		a defined interval of time, which is the "Time Between Elections." Lastly, the "Polling Time" is the
		amount of time at the beginning of each election where votes are tabulated.
		
		<br /><br />
		
		The constituency is made up of Agents and Utilities in the same group as the Polling Utility, which
		vote by sending the Polling Utility a message with their opinions enclosed, and the Polling Utility
		tallies them.
		
		<br /><br />
		
		The issues are a subset of the Propositions in the same group as the Polling Utility. Note that not
		every Agent in the consituency has to see all the issues, they can vote on the ones that they know
		about. You can add or remove issues using the checkboxes beside the names of the Propositions.
		
		<br /><br />
		
		Lastly, the Polling Utility needs a way to communicate the results of the polling right after it
		finishes. The Digests box tells you which Agents the Polling Utility will inform at the end of
		each and every election.
		
		<br /><br />
		
		Just remember to press "Save" once you're done configuring the utility!

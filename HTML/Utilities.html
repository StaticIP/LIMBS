        <h1>Utilities</h1>
		
		Utilities are like Agents in many ways. They communicate, they process messages,
		they have the same grouping principles. The one thing that makes Utilities
		different is their lightweighted-ness. Utilities lack emotional processing
		power and emotional communication, making them perfect to represent large
		entities or facilities that don't engage in emotional thought. Facilities like
		an elections committee, or the random fluctuations in a stock market.

		There are three utilities currently in LIMBS:
		
		<ul>
			<li>	Logging Utilities help you analyze transient behaviour in the simulation
					by outputing messages to a file
			</li>
			<li>	Event Utilities help you schedule external events which are not attributable
					to Agents, such as the weather, birthdays, or mudslides.
			</li>
			<li>	Polling Utilities helop you run referendums and collect aggregate information
					from multiple Agents.
			</li>
		</ul>

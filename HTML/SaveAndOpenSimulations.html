        <h1>Saving and Opening Simulations</h1>
        
        You can save your simulation at any time, regardless of whether it is finished or 
        unfinished. Simply navigate to the “File” menu at the top left-hand corner and select 
        “Save”. In the Save dialog, select the folder and filename under which you would like 
        to save your simulation, then select “Save”. Note: If a simulation is currently running 
        when you attempt to save, it will be stopped.
        
        <br /><br />
        
        To open a previously saved simulation, navigate to the top left-hand corner and select 
        “Open”. In the Open dialog, locate and select the simulation file you wish to open, 
        then select “Open”. The simulation will be restored to the application, and whatever 
        simulation is currently being used will be discarded.

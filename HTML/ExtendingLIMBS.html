        <h1>Extending the LIMBS Framework</h1>
		
		The LIMBS framework was purposefully designed to make extension as easy as possible, while making sure
		that some useful utilities, such as saving files, loading files, undoing, and redoing changes are
		consistant and available.
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		The first thing to know about extending LIMBS is that it was designed to be extended <i>at the cognitive level,</i>
		meaning that we intend for our user base to create their own agents and utilities using their own modelling
		framework and to suit their own needs. As agents and utilities are really the fundamental backbone, propositions
		and groups providing only a communication structure, this offers a large opportunity to create very diverse
		simulation components that can immediately interact on a meaningful level with other components.

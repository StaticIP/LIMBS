        <h1>Propositions, Agents and Groups</h1>
        
        <p>
            On the system-wide level, we have three main entities: Propositions, Agents and Groups. 
            This section explores what each of these entities is and how to add them to your simulation.
            <br /><br />
        </p>
        
        <h3>Propositions</h3>
        <table cellpadding="10px" >
            <tr>
                <td valign="top" >
                    <p>Propositions are any type of information that agents can communicate to each other, which are 
                    often the major pieces of information relevant in making a decision. They are split into three 
                    subgroups: evidence, which are the factors used to make a decision; actions, which are the 
                    results of the decision; and goals, which are the concepts that each agent may want to maximize... 
                    or minimize!
                    
                    <br /><br />
                    
                    Determining propositions is the first major step in understanding the breadth and scope of your model, 
                    but don’t worry right now about getting it definitely right, you can always go back and change the 
                    list as your understanding of the situation that you are trying to model changes! The goal of this 
                    stage is just to start populating the model without having to worry about fine tuning it!
                    
                    <br /><br />
                    
                    To add propositions to the model, just select the "Propositions" tab at the top of the application, and 
                    click the button for the proposition type you want to add. The new proposition will appear on the canvas! 
                    Evidence are represented as circles, actions as triangles, and goals as squares. Once you drag and drop 
                    them in, you can change their name using the properties bar. Just click on the object, and the right side 
                    of the interface should give you all the properties about it in the properties field. Just change the 
                    name field to whatever name you’ve given the proposition, and then hit “Apply” and it’s good to go!
                    
					<br /><br />
					
					Propositions are distinguished visually by both their shape and their colour. Evidence are cyan triangles,
					actions are medium blue squares, and goals are vibrant blue diamonds.

                    <i>Susan got out a pen and paper from the top drawer of her desk and started 
                    brainstorming. "What factors determine stock booms and busts?"
                    <br /><br />
                    After a moment’s thought, she determined that the stock buying behaviour of 
                    individual people was really what she wanted to model more than the booms and 
                    busts themselves. 
                    <br /><br />
                    "What are the factors making up these decisions? Well, the general rule I’ve 
                    always heard is that you buy stocks when they are low and sell them when they 
                    are high, so STOCK HIGH and STOCK LOW should be pieces of evidence. 
                    Realistically, though, you want to buy stocks if they are going up, so GOING UP 
                    and GOING DOWN could also be evidence. Same with buyer OPTIMISM and PESSIMISM, 
                    at least according to my first year macroeconomics professor!"
                    <br /><br />
                    "Now for actions, well, that’s easy! BUY STOCK and SELL STOCK! And since the 
                    only goal in the whole scheme is to MAKE MONEY, I’ll add that as a goal!"
                    <br /><br />
                    Susan leaned back in her chair, beaming at the piece of paper on her desk. That 
                    model seemed to get closer and closer to completion the more she thought. She 
                    smiled.</i>

                    Agents are the basic power-houses of your simulation. Eventually, you will learn how to customize each 
                    agent, giving them their own special way of thinking, making decisions and communicating with others. But 
                    don’t get too excited just yet, let’s focus on adding them to the system first!
                    
                    <br /><br />
                    
                    To add an agent, simply select the "Agent" tab at the top of the application, and click the "HOTCO Agent" button. 
                    The new agent will appear on the canvas! To edit the agent’s name, click on the agent on the canvas to select it, 
                    then use the name field in the properties panel to update its name. Remember to hit “Apply” when you’re done!
                    
					<br /><br />
                    
					All agents are circles, and the colour of the circle can give you some quick insight into their emotional state.
					Green means that the agent is feeling good, yellow meaning middling or emotionless, and read meaning bad. The
					colour can very between these, so a greenish-yellow can mean feeling somewhat good, while an orange could mean
					feeling somewhat bad.
					
                    <br /><br />
                    
					Utilities are simple, Agent-like components, which also make decisions and communicate, but do so in very strict,
					not psychological possible ways. They can be used to make the simulation easier to analyse, or to provide some
					aspects of the simulation that are not the responsibility of a single Agent, like external events, or referendums.
					Utilities are all identified as magenta octogons.

                    <i>"Agents," thought Susan, "well, that’s easy! I’ll just put in a few artificial 
                    stock traders. That’ll do the trick. But how many?"
                    <br /><br />
                    She paused.
                    <br /><br />
                    "Seven. It’s dead wrong, but at least it is a pretty good starting point! Besides, 
                    I always liked that number."

                    As with propositions, don’t worry too much about getting everything about the agent’s just right yet. Focus on 
                    getting an appropriate number of agents instead.

                    <i>"Do I even have any groups?" Susan thought out loud. "How are these buyers all 
                    related?"
                    <br /><br />
                    She paused again. Maybe modelling wasn’t going to be as easy as she originally 
                    thought. At least it isn’t as hard as she thought when she was given the assignment 
                    by her adviser less than an hour ago.
                    <br /><br />
                    "Well, I’ll just have a single BUYERS group for now. If I need any more, I’ll add 
                    them later."</i>

                        The last entity in the LIMBS framework that you need to think about are groups. Groups ask the question “How are 
                        agents and propositions organized?” This question can be answered in many ways depending on what you are trying 
                        to model. For example, if you are modeling an international negotiation, you may want a group for the negotiators, 
                        but you may also want a group for each country involved, so you can model the country giving its negotiators 
                        feedback on their decisions.
                        
                        <br /><br />
                        
                        An interesting thing about groups is that they may overlap. Taking the example of the international negotiators, 
                        each negotiator would be part of the negotiator group as well as the group for their respective country. So, each 
                        country can overlap with the negotiator group!

                    Once again, to add a group, simply select the "Group" tab, click the button, and the new group will appear on the canvas. 
                    To rename it, just click on the group then use the name field in the properties panel to update the group name. Remember 
                    to hit “Apply” to save the changes.

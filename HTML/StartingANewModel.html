                    So, you are new to the LIMBS framework, and you’re not sure exactly where to start. 
                    Well, then you are in the same situation as our mutual friend, Susan, who is creating 
                    her first agent based model of her graduate studies to model how emotional transfer 
                    affects stock market booms and busts. She will occasionally be joining us during our 
                    exploration into the LIMBS framework, so don’t worry. You’re not alone.
                    
                    <br /><br />
                    
                    So, once you have your computer started up and you’ve started running an instance of the 
                    LIMBS framework, you are ready to start creating a model. Creating a model relies on you 
                    following a design process, and although you are ultimately the only person who knows the 
                    correct design process for you, we recommend one that works pretty well for the LIMBS framework.

                    <i>The meeting went quicker than Susan had originally thought... 
                    and now she had another assignment to add to the pile.
                    <br /><br />
                    Susan sat down at her desk and looked at the computer screen sitting 
                    in front of her. "Where to start... where to start?" She looked at the 
                    blank screen again and sighed. "Well, I guess I should probably turn the 
                    computer on first."</i>

                        But before we get started, we’ll need to have a working knowledge of the different parts of the 
                        system-wide interface. There are three main areas in this workspace: the canvas, the toolkit and 
                        the properties field. The canvas is where you can see your model as it currently is. The toolkit 
                        bar at the top of the screen has all the entities like propositions, agents and groups, which you 
                        can add to the model by selecting them, then dragging and dropping them onto the canvas. Lastly, 
                        when you click on an entity on the canvas, the property field fills with all the properties and 
                        configurations of that one entity. Here you can edit each item’s name and maybe even some of its 
                        characteristics! When you are finished editing, remember to hit “Update!” just to make sure the 
                        changes really stick!
                        
                        <br /><br />
                        
                        Now that you know the basics of the system-wide interface, you are ready to design your very first LIMBS model!

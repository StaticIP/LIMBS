<html>    <body>            <h1>New Agents and Utilities</h1>				The fundamental functions of agents and utilities are to process messages, both incoming		and outgoing, and to keep a notion of state or mindset.				<h2>Grouping</h2>		These functions are how the system level manages propogating social structure down to the cognitive		level, and as this is the user's primary mean of interaction with the social level, each of these functions		must be carefully ensured to be protected with undo/redo logic.<br/><br/>		The addPropositionInternal and removePropositionInternal are used to inform this interface of when a proposition		is no longer visible, or valid for the agent/utility to talk about. This method should make sure that the system		state should no longer contain references to old propositions, or to make sure that new propositions are taken		into account accordingly.<br/>		<b>protected void addPropositionInternal( Proposition p );</b><br/>		<b>protected void removePropositionInternal( Proposition p );</b><br/><br/>		As addPropositionInternal and removePropositionInternal are used to inform this interface of when a proposition		is no longer visible addCommunicationAgentInternal and removeCommunicationAgentInternal do the same thing but		for agents that the current agent can communicate with. This method should make sure that the system		state should no longer contain references to old agents, or to make sure that new avenues for communication are taken		into account accordingly.<br/>		<b>protected void addCommunicationAgentInternal( Agent a );</b><br/>		<b>protected void removeCommunicationAgentInternal( Agent a );</b><br/>		<h2>Message Processing</h2>		<b>public void setup();</b><br/>		This function is for resetting the state of the agents outside of the grouping structure, and		is really only used when the "stop" or "reset" buttons are pressed. In the HOTCO Agent for example,		this function restores the value of each and every node to it's initial value, and updates the 		agent's emotional accordingly. <br/><br/>		<b>public void communicate();</b><br/>		This function is for communicating information to other agents and utilities, and is the first step		in each iteration in the simulation. At this stage, your agent or utility should be deciding who to		send messages to, and creating those messages. <br/><br/>		<b>public void iterateThroughQueue();</b><br/>		This function is for the second part of each iteration in the simulation: processing incoming messages		and fitting them into the agent or utility's current state. This can be achieved through polling the		messageQueue variable to collect messages sent by other agents and utilities.<br/><br/>				<h2>Querying the Agent's Overall Emotion</h2>		As emotion processing is also a fundamental part of the LIMBS framework, getting an overall		idea of an Agent's emotion is absolutely fundamental. (Note that you cannot overwrite this		methods in the utility class to maintain the integrity of utilities as not modeling people		but emotionless processes and facilities.)<br/>		<b>public double queryEmotionValence();</b><br/>		<b>public double queryEmotionIntensity();</b><br/>		<b>public double queryEmotionPotency();</b><br/>		<h2>Querying the Agent or Utility About a Proposition</h2>		Lastly, the simulation also needs a way to query the agent or utility's state about particular propositions,		guaranteed to be visible by the agent. To facilitate this, a query structure is used, where first, queryProposition		is called, giving you time to set up the required variables, and then some combination of the get propositional activation,		valence, intensity or potency are called. To signify the end of this query, the completeQuery function will be called.<br/>		<b>public void queryProposition( Proposition prop );</b><br/>		<b>public double getPropositionalActivation();</b><br/>		<b>public double getPropositionalValence();</b><br/>		<b>public double getPropositionalIntensity();</b><br/>		<b>public double getPropositionalPotency();</b><br/>		<b>public void completeQuery();</b><br/>			</body>></html>

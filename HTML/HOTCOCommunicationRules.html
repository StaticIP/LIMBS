        <h1>HOTCO Communication Rules</h1>
        <p>
        	This section describes how you can add communication rules to your HOTCO agent. 
			You can also add nodes to each communication rule. Also, you can modify the receptiveness 
			of the HOTCO Agent under "Receptiveness" (default value: 1.0).

			<br /><br />
			
			To create a new communication rule, click the "New Rule" button. The new rule appears 
			in the scroll pane underneath the button. Once you have created your new rule, you can change 
			its settings by doubling-clicking the rule, revealing a settings window. In this 
			window, you can change the name of the rule, modify its threshold (default value: 0.5) 
			and update its target. You can only select one HOTCO Agent as a target for each rule. 
			Finally, you can also remove a rule by clicking the "Remove Rule" button below the scroll pane.
			
			<br /><br />
			
			Nodes can be added to each rule. To add a node to a rule, select the rule that you 
			want to modify. Next, select the nodes on the canvas that will be added to the rule, 
			and then click "Add". You also have the option of removing nodes from the rule. 
			Simply select the node in the scroll pane under "Nodes" and click "Remove".

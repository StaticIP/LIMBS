        <h1>Cloning Components</h1>
        
        In some larger simulations, you might find the need to have many components, especially Agents and Utilities that are very 
        similar, or identical. In this case, it would be very tedious and time-consuming to 
        create each agent separately. This is where the cloning feature comes in handy. 
        In order to clone a component, select it on the main canvas by clicking on it. Then, 
        you can either press "Ctrl-C" pr select “Clone” from the Edit menu.
        
        <br /><br />
        
        When cloning components, all properties of the component are copied except for the unique ID 
        number. (Don’t worry. The copy will receive its own unique ID!) Keep this in mind when 
        using the clone feature.

                    The section Communication Rules describes how to get your HOTCO Agent to send messages,
					However, these rules do not describe how the agent receives these messages. 
                    Well, the receiver can receive messages via a range of emotional transfer mechanisms. 
                    
                    These mechanisms are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Emotional Contagion</li>
                        <li>Emotional Altruism</li>
                        <li>Emotional Empathy</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    All of these mechanisms rely on the transferring of emotional vectors along with a certain 
                    set of propositions. Contagion transfers emotional information regarding actions. Altruism 
                    transfers emotional information regarding goals. Empathy transfers emotional information 
                    regarding evidence. These allow for common socio-emotional phenomena to occur through the 
                    spread of emotions as well as information in communication.

                    To access these mechanisms, once again, you must go to the HOTCO interface. Select 
                    “Emotional Transfer Rules” from the “Agent Options” menu at the top of the interface. This 
                    will open a dialog showing four text boxes. The first list, “Agents,” will include all the 
                    agents that one can communication with, as well as a DEFAULT person. To use emotional 
                    transfer mechanisms, just select an item from the “Agents” list, then click on the “Add” 
                    button below one of the other “Contagion,” Altruism,” and “Empathy” lists to add that 
                    agent to that list. Removing an agent works the same way. Just select the agent from the 
                    “Agents” list, and hit remove from below whatever list you want to remove the agent from. 
                    The DEFAULT agent will represent all agents that have not been placed in a list, allowing 
                    you to easily specify a default emotional transfer mechanism, but customize the mechanism 
                    for any communication link.

                    <i>“Contagion,” Susan thought. Everyone in her department was talking about it, 
                    the phenomena of emotions spreading like wildfire through a social group...

                    “Perfect,” Susan thought as she dragged all of the Agents in the list to contagion.

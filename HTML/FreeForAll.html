        <h1>The Free-For-All Model</h1>
        
        The Free-For-All model is all based around the concept of having a relatively unstructured 
        collection of individuals where the communication links between the individuals may be 
        blurry at best. In this case, it may be best to abstract away from complicated structures 
        and mechanisms and rely on some of the LIMBS framework’s default settings.
        
        <br /><br />
        
        In the Free-For-All model, every Agent and every Proposition are all members of one single 
        Group, and every Agent has a communication link to every other agent. On a system wide 
        level, this begins to look something like this:
        
        <br /><br />
        
        On the individual agent level, the communication mechanisms are left to the HOTCO default 
        (assuming you are using HOTCO agents) which means that at every iteration, the agent will 
        select another agent at random to communicate with, abstracting away any potentially 
        complicated communication structures. Often, all of the agents may have exactly the same, 
        or at least very similar, internal structure, so copying and pasting agents can save a lot 
        of time. Additionally, an external events agent can be used to simulate events that change 
        the entire environment, for every agent.

        Ideal uses for this model may include:
        
        <ul>
            <li>stock market booms and busts,</li>
            <li>crowd dynamics and mob mentality, and</li>
            <li>and any problem where there are many agents, but how the agents interact with each 
            other is so complicated, it might as well be random.</li>
        </ul>

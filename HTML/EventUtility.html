                    In many social modelling scenarios, external influences can act as the initialization of 
                    different social phenomena. For example, stock market crashes often require some small 
                    starting decrease in stock price, just due to random effects or the company’s success, 
                    for the crash to be initialized. After that initial decrease, stock owners sell their 
                    stocks, trying to sell high, which further decreases the stock price, hence a crash.

                    <i>Susan beamed at the model with a sense of accomplishment. It was nearly complete. 
                    The last addition would be to somehow turn the stock market bubble she planned to 
                    start with to a stock market crash. None of the agents themselves seemed to be able 
                    to do this, all of them believing that the stock would always rise, and therefore 
                    always buy it.
                    <br /><br />
                    She looked through the LIMBS Framework User Manual again, skimming over the rather 
                    tedious and annoying blue boxes cluttering the pages. The last section was on 
                    external events. “Perfect!” She thought. “I’ll have an external event force the 
                    stock price down halfway through the simulation to get the crash I need!”
                    <br /><br />
                    After scheduling the crash event, Susan pressed the “Run Simulation” button again, 
                    holding her breath, waiting excitedly for the results and hoping they would be 
                    good enough for her advisor.

                    To include simplified models of these external influences, an event scheduling 
                    mechanism is provided. First, create an Event Utility, and place it in the Group
					of your choice. Since Utilities act like Agents, the Event Utility will only be
					able to send messages to Agents in one if its Group.

					<br/><br/>
					
                    The event interface will automatically load with no events. To create a new event,
					just populate this interface with information and hit save. The event will 
					broadcast to the agents identified in the agents list, with a message containing
					the information specified in the propositions list.

        <h1>The Basic HOTCO Agent Interface</h1>
        <p>
            In an agent based model, like the ones you will be creating with the LIMBS Framework, 
            the Agents are truly the powerhouses of computation, the mitochondria of the social 
            cells. The HOTCO interface allows you to customize each Agent’s individual cognitive 
            process, allowing Agents to think differently, reason based on different criteria, 
            and overall, add depth and variety to your simulations!
            
            <br /><br/>
            
            HOTCO Models are made up of two things: nodes and links. Nodes represent Propositions, 
            or concepts, or just about anything! (In fact, each Agent’s interface will be 
            automatically populated with a set of nodes, each one representing a Proposition that 
            the Agent has access to on the system level!)  Nodes also have an activation value 
            and an emotion vector attached to each of them. These four numbers represent: 
            
            <ol>
                <li>How true the Agent thinks what the node represents is (the activation value)</li>
                <li>How pleasant the emotional stance the Agent has on what the node represents 
                (the emotional valence)</li>
                <li>How intense this emotional stance is (the emotional intensity)</li>
                <li>And how much control over the Agent feels, consciously or subconsciously) 
                they have over what the node represents (the emotional potency)</li>
            </ol>
            Links connect to nodes together, representing how compatible they are. For example, 
            the node named PARENTS may be very compatible with a node named LOVE, and thus have 
            an excitatory link between them, but LIVER AND ONIONS may not be very compatible with 
            DELICIOUS, and thus have an inhibitory link between them.
            
            <br /><br />
            
            These links, as well as the initial activation value and emotional vector, determine 
            how the Agent thinks. Overall, Agent’s will aim to maximize the coherence of the 
            HOTCO model, meaning that nodes connected by an excitatory link will try to have 
            as close to the same activation value as possible, and nodes connected by an 
            inhibitory link will try to have as different an activation value as possible. The 
            emotions factor in by increasing the activation of nodes with similar emotions (when 
            you are happy, you are more likely to belief happy things) but even these are subject 
            to coherence in a similar fashion.
            
            <br /><br />
            
            Overall, to add a node to the HOTCO interface, just select one from the toolkit at 
            the top of the interface, and drag and drop it onto the canvas. To delete them, just 
            select a node and press the “Delete” key on your keyboard. (Note that you can’t delete 
            nodes representing system level propositions!) To add a link, click on one of the 
            nodes, then chose an excitatory or inhibitory link from the toolkit, and drag it onto 
            the second node. To modify the initial and current values of each node, simply click 
            on the node, and modify the eight number fields in the upper right corner of the 
            interface.
            
            <br /><br />
            
            Once you’re done here, you are ready to run your very first simulation!

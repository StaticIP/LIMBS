        <h1>Messages and Communication</h1>
		
		Once you have all these Agents and Utilities set up, and in Groups, you may wonder exactly
		how these things interact. What is the basis for their communication?
		
		<br /><br />
		
		Each Agent and Utility have the ability to send and receive little packages of information called Messages.
		Each Message contains Propositions that the sending and receiving components have in common, with the 
		activation and emotional information for those Propositions attached, allowing the receiver to know
		exactly the sender's level of belief and emotion for each Proposition they share.
